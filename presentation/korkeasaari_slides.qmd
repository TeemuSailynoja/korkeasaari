# Introduction

Welcome to the Korkeasaari Zoo PyMC timeseries modeling presentation.

# Data Sources & Preprocessing

- **Visitor data:** Daily counts from Korkeasaari Zoo (`data/clean/visitors.csv`).
  - Columns: `date`, `visitors`, `day_of_week` (Finnish abbreviations)
  - Low visitor counts indicate closure days.
- **Weather data:** Daily rain and max temperature (`data/clean/weather.csv`).
  - Columns: `date`, `rain_sum`, `temperature_2m_max`
  - Date standardized to `YYYY-MM-DD` for merging.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Checked for missing/duplicate dates in both datasets
  - Filtered to overlapping date range
  - Merged datasets on `date`
  - Saved merged data to `data/clean/visitors_weather_merged.csv`

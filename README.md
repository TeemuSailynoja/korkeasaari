# Iterative Bayesian Modelling: Korkeasaari Zoo

Materials from my [PyData Helsinki](https://pydata-helsinki.github.io/) 2025 talk on iteratively building up a Bayesian model to predict Korkeasaari Zoo visitor counts.

## Key Findings
- During 2023, Korkeasaari Zoo lost 20,000 to 40,000 visitors due to rainy days in the summer
- The impact of the tiger cubs born in September 2022 was likely small, 1000 or so additional visitors, but difficult to estimate using open data alone
